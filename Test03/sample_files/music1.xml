            The structure of a patterned song borrows heavily from Famitracker's UI disposition:
            First you got some [metadata] which will hold useful for the engine to interpret your song
            (in the case of the NES you got a basetempo and a divider)

            Then you got a pattern [map], which will tell how patterns will be played. When one of those
            patterns (besides the null '-' pattern), the song will go to the next one. (This in an
            effort to avoid the uncomfortable D00 effects you have to put at the end of nearly
            every pattern in Famitracker. There is an attribute for each channel's ID. (which will be given
            in the [system] tag above, or your XML preset.

            Finally, the patterns. There will be a [patterns] tag for each channel, holding each one's ID.
            They have [pattern] children, each one with an index attribute (used above in [map]).

            [frame] children have field related attributes. Fields are defined in the [system] tag or
            your XML preset, and interpreted appropriately by the playback engine. Incomplete information
            is filled with NULLs. ('-')

            IN CASE IT'S NOT A PATTERNED SONG, like a MIDI or a Pokemon RBY/GSC hack, you can delete the "map" tag.
            That will make the song to only look for the [pattern] tags. Only the first one for each channel
            will be read, omitting the others, and their [index] parameter.
