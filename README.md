# WhimsyDataStructs #
Some module tests for core data structures for a program I want to make as a personal project.

## How to compile ##
Nothing besides C++ standard library and a C++11 compatible compiler such as GCC. This uses CMake as a convenient way to get everything built.

### Which test modules does it have ###
This has 3 test modules.
- _Test01_: This module features Variant functionality.
- _Test02_: This module features a more robust core class system, and ultimately, tests the TypedTable, basis for future data structures.
- _Test03_: This module features IO file support, testing how these data structures will hold and arrange data in several, flexible formats.
